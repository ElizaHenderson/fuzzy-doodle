##Description:<br>
  This project is for the Spring 2016 GUI class at OIT. This project is intended to be a Munchkins companion app developed in QT. This is intended to assist players in keeping track of their door counter while playing the card game Munchkins. The overall idea is to assist players by having a mobile or desktop app that players can tap or click in order to keep track of doors kicked down/levels gained through doors.
